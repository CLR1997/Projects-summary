# Projects-summary

This github project serves as a collection of more noteworthy coding projects which I've completed or have been able to complete as part of a group and that I'm allowed to share. I also want to highlight that the SMLE was created by Francobaldi & Lombardi from the University of Bologna, the original project can be found here: github link. I only worked on a small part of it, however I've decided to upload the entire project, as otherwise my contributions wouldn't make any sense.
